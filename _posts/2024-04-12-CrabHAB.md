**DISCLAIMER!** - All data used to generate tables or graphs for this illustration of my work is **FAKE**. Due to privacy concerns, I cannot legally show these figures with the data from the actual fishermen.


# Data Summary
### Variables Used
*Not all variables in the CDFW (**C**alifornia **D**epartment of **F**ish and **W**ildlife) files we used were used by me. The ones described below are the ones I worked with.*
## Fishermen Landings Data
These data contain records of fishtickets submitted by fishermen on upon selling to a particular business. A separate ticket must be issued for each species sold by the fisheremen.


Variables provided with the dataset:  

| Variable | Description |  
| ---------------- | ------------- |  
| **LandingReceiptNum** | Landing Receipt Number, a unique identifier for each fish ticket |  
| **LandingDate** | The date the fishticket was submitted |  
| **FisherID** | Unique identifier for each fisherman submitting a fishticket |  
| **Pounds** | Weight of all the fish caught for that specific ticket. |  
| **UnitPrice** | The price per pound of fish for that species. Generally used to check that the **Pounds** and **TotalPrice** made agreed |  
| **TotalPrice** | The total price the fisherman charged a business for selling their fish |  
| **SpeciesGroup** | Which species group the fish belong to. This is **NOT** the same as species; these are CDFW defined groups created based on organizational and conservational purposes. |  
| **GearGroup** | The method of catching the fish. E.g. trap, trawling, longline, etc |  
| **FishingYear**\* | The CDFW fishing year is April 1st to March 31st of next year, this adjusts the year so a **FishingYear** of 2016 refers to April 1st, 2016 to March 31st, 2017. A fishticket submitted on February 14th 2012 will be in **FishingYear**: 2011 |
